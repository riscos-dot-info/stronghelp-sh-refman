Image file format
You should normally not need to know the image file format, and you should not depend on it being constant.

	All offsets are from the start of the file.
	All blocks should start at a word-aligned offset, though versions of StrongHelp before 2.53 didn't do that correctly.
	The block size includes the two leading words, but is not neccessarily aligned. The offset from one block to the next should be {fcode:(blocksize+3) AND NOT 3} (if version >= 2.53)
	Well, that's not strictly true.. Between the blocks there can be a sequence of zero bytes. (When a FREE block is reused, whatever is left over is made into a new FREE block, but only if it is > 32 bytes. Else it is just zeroed out.)
