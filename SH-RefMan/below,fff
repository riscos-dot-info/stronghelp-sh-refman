Below
Full syntax :
#fCode; Indent 4
Below
#f;Indent

This tells StrongHelp that the following text or graphics should appear below everything that is on the page so far.

You would normally use this to get below sprites or drawfiles where the x or y coordinate is given as an absolute value. (If you use "c,f" as the coordinate then the text automatically continues below)

Example:
#fCode
\#Sprite 0,f !StrongHlp; Indent 8
Here is a line to the right of the sprite
\#Indent; below
Here is a line below the sprite.
#f
