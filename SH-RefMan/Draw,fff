Draw
Full syntax :
#fCode; Indent 4
Draw x,y drawfilename
#f;Indent

x is no or "centre"
y is no or "float"
0,0 is in top left corner

This places a Drawfile at the requested postion. To actually render it, StrongHelp relies on the DrawFile module released by Acorn. If this is not present, StrongHelp will just leave the space empty.

Example:
#fCode
\#Draw 0,0 !i
#f
