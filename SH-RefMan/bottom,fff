Bottom
Full syntax :
#fCode; Indent 4
Bottom
#f;Indent

After StrongHelp have found the required height of a page, it moves everything below {fcode:#Bottom} down, so that the last line *is* at the bottom. This can be useful if you have a background image (like this manual has) and want to round it off with some text at the bottom.

Example:
#fCode
\#Draw c,c !logo
Some text at the start of the page
\#bottom
And some at the bottom.
#f
