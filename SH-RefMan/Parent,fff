Parent
Full syntax :
#fCode; Indent 4
\#parent name
#f;Indent

This tells StrongHelp which page to open at adjust-close of the current page, when it has no other history.

When you click on a link and open a page, the new page gets the history of the old page + the name of the old page itself, but the *first* page has *no* history, and that is where "Parent" enters.

The main reason for using "Parent" is to tie pages opened by pressing "F1" in an editor to a hierarchy.

Example:
#fCode
Wimp_Poll (&400C7)
\#Parent Wimp_
#f
