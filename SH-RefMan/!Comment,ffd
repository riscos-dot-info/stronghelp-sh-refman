Comment
Full syntax :
#fCode; Indent 4
\# Some text. Note first space
#f;Indent

When this occurs at the beginning of a line, StrongHelp ignores the rest of the line. A line with only a single "#" on it is also ignored.

Example:
#fCode
\# We comment out this command for the time being.
\# Draw 0,0 !i
#f
