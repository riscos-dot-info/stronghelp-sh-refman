Wrap
Full syntax :
#fCode; Indent 4
\#Wrap [ On | Off | Nojoin ]
#f;Indent

This tells StrongHelp how to preprocess the lines in a paragraph, and how to display them.

On	All textlines not interrupted by a blank line or a "#" will be joined to one line, and wrapped to fit the window.
Off	StrongHelp will do nothing with the text, and not wrap it either
NoJoin	StrongHelp will not join lines, but will wrap them. (ie each paragraph is written as one long line)

Use just "Wrap" to restore the previous setting (just one level)

Example:
#fCode
#Wrap off
\#Wrap off
This is a line that I don't want StrongHelp to split
#f
