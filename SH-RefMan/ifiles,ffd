Special files
#fh4:In any manual

#tab fcode
!Configure	Contains font definitions for this manual

!Root		The page that is displayed when a manual is clicked.

NotFound_{/}manual{/}	These pages are used if you have a link to another manual, and that manual isn't installed. You can use these pages to describe what the external manual is, and where it can be found.

{/}a{/}>{/}b{/}		This is a redirection. When you link to, or do a lookup on /a/, you get page /b/ instead.

#fh4:In the StrongHelp manual

!Menu		The page that is displayed when the user clicks on the StrongHelp iconbar icon.

#fh4:In !StrongHelp directory

!Configure	The master configuration file.

DrawWrap	When you link directly to a draw file, this file is used as a glue page.

MDirWrap	Subdirectories in !Manuals behave partly like manuals themselves, and when linked to StrongHelp looks for a !Root file. If that doesn't exist, this file is used instead.
