#fh1:Changes between v 2.53 and 2.60

è	You can define your own styles.

#Indent 4
#fcode
\#fTest= f* rgb 255,0,0
...
This is a \{ftest:test\}
#f
#indent

è	You can do {fcode:{f*:test\}}

è	You can start a comment line with {fcode:##} or {fcode:#!}

è	You can give width and height for {fcode:#sprite}

#Indent 4
The real width is read from the sprite itself, but you can give the complete bounding box, so that when you place multiple sprites in a group they center about the same spot.

You can also use it to decide if the text should come below or to the right of the sprite; Set a height equal to or less than 50, and the text will come to the right.
#indent

è	You can now change font right in front of a tabbed list, and the whole list *will* use that font. (A bug caused StrongHelp to get a bit confused about fonts in tables)

è	The old hack that replaced occurrences of the 'up-arrow' character with the text "Sh-" has been removed. I tried replacing this hack with one that replaced it with the arrow symbol from the WimpSymbols font, but decided it wasn't worth it.

è	In the Help_Search usermessage, you can now use {fcode:!x20} if you want to send a search expression containing spaces. (This is needed because StrongHelp takes everything *before* the last literal space to be the search {f*:path})
