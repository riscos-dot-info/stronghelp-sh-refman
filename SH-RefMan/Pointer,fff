Pointer
Full syntax :
#fCode; Indent 4
\#Pointer [0|1]
#f;Indent

This command controls whether the pointer is switched to a hand when over a link. It works on a per-page basis, but this is for internal use only. {*}Do not use this command.{*}

This command is used by default to diable pointer context switching on the StrongHelp main menu pages. In all other cases this is a user choice.

Example:
#fCode
Another advanced example:
\#Pointer 1
#f
