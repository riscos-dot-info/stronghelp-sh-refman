Strong, Italic and Underline
Full syntax :
#fCode; Indent 4
Here is a \*strong\* word
Here is a strong expression : \{\*} 2*3*4 \{\*}
#f;Indent

To simplify the use of the <styles=>f> "Strong", "Emphasis" and "Underline" we use the characters *, / and _ (underscore) directly in the text, or as commands inside "\{}"

If used directly, there must be a space or newline in front of the first "*", only letters and spaces between, and space, newline or punctuation after the second "*", and both "*"'s must be next to a letter.

To actually display a "*" prefix it with "\\"

Example:
#fCode
I must tell you Darla, I have \*strong\* feelings about this, and that's no \/joke\/.
#f
