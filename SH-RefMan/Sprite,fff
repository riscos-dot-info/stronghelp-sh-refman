Sprite
Full syntax :
#fCode; Indent 4
\#Sprite x,y[,w,h] name [label] [=>link]
#f;Indent

x is no or "centre"
y is no or "float"
0,0 is in top left corner

This places a sprite at the requested position. The sprite is either from a previously defined <Spritefile>, or it is a Wimp sprite.

Normally the icon will get the size of the sprite, but if you want several icons to be next to each other and aligned sensibly, you can give a specific width and height.

Example:
#fCode
Here comes the "Acorn" sprite from the Wimp pool:
\#sprite c,f switcher
#f
