Using StrongHelp from your Application

#fh1:Simple launch

If you just want to open the root page of your manual, you can use the Filer_Run OS command. In your !app.!help file that would look like this:

#fcode:  Filer_Run \<app$dir\>.Resources.uk.appmanual

If you examine StrongHelp's own !help file, you'll see that it does more or less this, but with an added step to support multiple languages.

From within your application you'd do basically the same:

#wrap off
#tab ,fcode
C	system("Filer_Run \<app$dir\>.Resources.uk.appmanual");

BASIC	OSCLI "Filer_Run \<app$dir\>.Resources.uk.appmanual"

Assembly	ADR R0,help
		SWI "OS_CLI"
		...
		.help EQUS "Filer_Run \<app$dir\>.Resources.uk.appmanual":=0
#tab
#wrap

#fh1:Opening a specific page

If it's not the root page you're after, you'll have to do slightly more work.You broadcast a Help_Word message. If the message bounces, you use {fcode:StrongHelp$Dir} to launch StrongHelp, and then send the message anew.
