Indent
Full syntax :
#fCode; Indent 4
\Indent [[+]number]
#f;Indent

This is used to indent paragraphs of text. Currently this is given in OS characters (ie actual OS width is number * 16) Use "+" to add indent to current indent, and "Indent" by itself to go back one level to previous indent.

Currently using Indent is the only way to put text to the right of graphics in the margin.

Example:
#fCode
Level 0
\#Ident 4
Level 4
\#Indent +4
Level 8
\#Indent
Level 4 again
\#Indent
Back to 0
#f
