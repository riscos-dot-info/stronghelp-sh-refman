Tag
Full syntax
#Fcode; indent 4
\#TAG tag
#indent; f

This command was introduced in version 2.20 of StrongHelp. You use it to define a position within a page that a link can refer to. You can refer to a tag in the current page like this:
#Fcode; indent 4
\<display=\>#TAG [tag]\>
#Indent; f

If you don't specify a tag, it will use the displayed text as the tag.

You can refer to tags in other pages like this:
#Fcode; indent 4
\<display=\>page#tag\>
#indent; f
